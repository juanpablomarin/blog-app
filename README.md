# Blog/Portfolio Application

## Introduction

This project is in the works to be some sort of portfolio/blog site! I started this project to get a better grasp on full-stack web development and implement good coding practices.

Starting from scratch allows for so many learning opportunities, like security issues, infrastructure, git workflow and some other things that'll *definitely* come up as this starts being developed.

There are a few things I want to address though, such as my choices for technologies.
